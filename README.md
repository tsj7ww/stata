# PredML: Enterprise-Grade Prediction Modeling Package

PredML is a Python package that provides a robust, scalable framework for building and deploying machine learning models for various prediction tasks. It supports classification, regression, and includes comprehensive feature engineering capabilities.

## Features

- Support for multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- Automated feature engineering and preprocessing
- Cross-validation and model evaluation
- Comprehensive logging and model tracking
- Docker support for development and deployment
- Extensive test coverage
- Type hints and documentation

## Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install predml
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predml.git
cd predml
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from predml.models import ClassificationModel
from predml.preprocessing import FeatureEngineer
from predml.training import ModelTrainer

# Initialize components
model = ClassificationModel(model_type="random_forest")
feature_engineer = FeatureEngineer(
    numeric_features=['feature1', 'feature2'],
    categorical_features=['category1']
)
trainer = ModelTrainer(model, feature_engineer)

# Train model
metrics = trainer.train(data, target_column='target', stratify=True)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```
